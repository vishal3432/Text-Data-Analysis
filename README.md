# YouTube Analysis 📈 🔍

Understand what makes YouTube content succeed—​from titles and tags to sentiment, emojis, and engagement.  
This repository ships a self‑contained Jupyter Notebook, **`youtube_analysis.ipynb`**, that walks you through:

1. Loading raw CSV data exported from the YouTube API or other sources  
2. Performing sentiment analysis on video titles/descriptions  
3. Generating word‑cloud and emoji frequency visualizations  
4. Exploring category‑level insights (likes, views, trending frequency, etc.)  
5. Exporting your cleaned/annotated dataset to **CSV, JSON, or SQLite**  
6. Answering 10+ business questions such as  
   - *Which category earns the most likes?*  
   - *Are audiences truly engaged?*  
   - *Do punctuation marks in titles/tags correlate with performance?*
